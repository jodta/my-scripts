# ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ Sigma Spy (Restored) ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿

**A recovered and modernized version of Sigma Spy for Roblox.**

---

## ⚡ How It Works

Sigma Spy hooks into Roblox services and objects to monitor remote calls, player data, and events in real time.  
It runs **entirely locally** and uses a modular system for stability and ease of extension.  
The system handles communication, parses Roblox objects into serialized formats, and automatically initializes hooks for `LocalPlayer` and their character.  
Logs and live data are displayed in a custom UI window with optional font support.
