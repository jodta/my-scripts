# Sigma Spy (Restored)

**A recovered and modernized version of Sigma Spy for Roblox.**

Sigma Spy works by **hooking into Roblox services and objects** to monitor remote calls, player data, and events in real time. It uses a modular system:

- **Communication Module**: Handles queued messages, remote function calls, and logs.
- **Parser Module**: Converts Roblox objects, vectors, enums, and tables into serialized formats.
- **Actor System**: Automatically initializes hooks and monitors specific targets like `LocalPlayer` and their character.
- **UI Module**: Displays logs, modals, and live data in a custom window with optional font support.

The system is designed to **run entirely locally**, avoiding reliance on live HTTP requests for stability.
